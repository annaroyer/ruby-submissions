### Project Template

### RTD NextDoor

### Pitch

Help people coordinate with their neighbors to get neighborhood ecopasses through RTD.

### Problem

RTD bus passes are expensive, which can deter people from using public transportation. RTD's Neighborhood EcoPass option makes them significantly more affordable (for me, I pay ~20% of what I would have without the pass), and the more neighbors who pitch in, the less expensive it is for everyone, but it can be challenging to coordinate and organize. 

### Solution

Users can search their home address and the application will either show them the existing eco pass group and allow them to sign up for it or give them a link to start coordinating an ecopass in their neighborhood.

### MVP

What is your MVP? Be very specific about what pieces of functionality will be in place.

#### Must have MVP:

Users can search their home address and will see:
* a link to join an existing eco pass group (if it exists) -> Not sure where I will get this data.
* a link to start a NECO pass program in your neighborhood (if it doesn't exist)
  * This would mean contacting the NECO pass program coordinator either via phone or email
* a message telling them they don't live in the regional transportation district area :(

When a user joins an existing eco pass group, 
they fill in their personal information
(** I need to check back on what this is and this might not be necessary for MVP)

Users fill out a survey on how much they are willing to contribute and optionally what bus routes they plan to use and how often

Neighborhood coordinators can see and access all users' entered contact information in their group

Users in an existing eco pass group can see:
* How much each member will need to contribute for the neighborhood to get ecopasses
* How far they are from their goal ($$ wise)

#### Hope to reach (beyond my initial MVP):

Some ideas:

* Coordinates volunteer efforts for canvassing and collecting money
* Connects to social media sites for online networking to assist the neighbors in canvassing 

* Allows for "block leader" users in addition to regular users and neighborhood coordinators

* Handles neighborhood renewals in addition to initializing a neighborhood program.

* The application handles contacting the program coordinator and receiving responses when a user decides to start a new NECO program

* Allow admin to send email updates to everyone in their NECO group through the application
* OR the application sends updates automatically via email (like when the group has fulfilled all the requirements to get neighborhood eco passes)

* The application sends admin users email or text message updates when something related to their NECO pass group changes (new registered user, user updated how much they are able to pay, etc.)

* the application gets the user's location if they are at home when they register

* Information on the application about where you can use your eco pass to get discounts near you 
* Map view of eco pass neighborhoods (not sure about this one)

* Users can submit payment and/or documents/ photographs through the application to their neighborhood admin

Unfortunately, this project is going to require me to read through the documents on the website about what it takes to start and organize a program and information about it. But I guess that is partially why the application is useful. 
I will consider reaching out to my neighborhood coordinator about the process for initializing and renewing a NECO pass program.

### Target Audience

People living in the Greater Denver area, especially commuters who want more affordable passes.

### New Technologies

express backend
OOJS
mocha/chai
I will try to use Docker to deploy the app or implement a security strategy we learned about


### User Stories

You must have at least 5 of the first user stories for you app up on your board in order for this to be approved. We recommend referencing the user stories provided in Quantified Self for great examples.

### Wireframes

Please provide screen shots of your wireframes for each part of your application.
Will add asap
